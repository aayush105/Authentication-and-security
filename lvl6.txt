OAuth -> Open Authorisation
 	a) Granular Access levels
 	-> what kind of data request the app wants, that datas will only be requested to any other application during login. Eg: if we login through Facebook in our application then we can set what data of the user's facebook account we want to get like Name and gmail.
 	
 	b) Read/Read +  Write Access
 	 -> we can read the user's details like name, gmail, address etc thorugh facebook login or we 
 	 can ask for the write action.
 	 
 	c) Revoke Access
 	-> thrid party that we are using to authenticate should able to revoke at any point on their website. 
 	
how does it work?

1) set up Your App
2) Redirect to authenticate
3) User logs In
4) user grant permission
5) receive authorisation code
6) exchange AuthCode for Access token
